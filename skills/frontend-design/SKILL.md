This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Use Century Gothic exclusively — this is the oOh!media brand font. `font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif`. Bold for headings and CTAs; Regular for body copy. No other fonts.
- **Color & Theme**: Use the oOh!media brand palette. Lead with oOh! Orange `#FF5F2C`. Use Moonlight Purple `#14172A` for dark/premium treatments, Urban Grey `#F2F2F2` for light backgrounds, Standard White `#FFFFFF` as the natural partner. Twilight Purple `#6A2AE1` for accents and data viz. Secondary palette (Ocean Blue `#276EF1`, Coral Peach `#FED8B1`, Sky Blue `#CFE6FA`, Desert Yellow `#FDBA12`) for supporting elements only. Commit to a cohesive oOh! brand aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use non-brand fonts (use Century Gothic only) or non-brand colour schemes (use the oOh!media palette exclusively — lead with oOh! Orange). Avoid predictable layouts and component patterns; avoid cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively within the oOh! brand — no two designs should look the same even with the same palette. Vary between light and dark treatments, orange-dominant and white-dominant layouts, different compositional approaches. The constraint is the brand, not creativity.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
